Q: Why?

A: Because, at one point I wanted to download the Arcology Podcast (www.arcologypodcast.com) and their feed, due to a confluence of weirdness within iTunes and Wordpress, was only the most recent ten items. This, being annoying, lead me to want to go back to the beginning. So, I downloaded every mp3 they had put out, and I began to write some perl to make it into a feed my podcatcher could read and then deliver to my phone in a sensible manner. Once I'd one that, I realized other people might want this.
